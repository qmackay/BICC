density from /Python Code/Crtitical/creating_ice_equiv_ngripdensity.ipynb, calculated via the EGRIP methodology. https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.962754. Not perfect, but better than existing singular datasets.

acc rate, thinning function, LID from AICC2012

horizons/intervals will be from layer count, which was adjusted to ngrip 1 until age 730 (159.345 -> 159.628) then ngrip2 for rest from GICC21 (till 3244; 582.4m). 
Then using GICC05 chronology, NGRIP1 from 3245 age (580.81) until 9526 (1346.87), then NGRIP2 for the rest (from 9527, 1346.42).
