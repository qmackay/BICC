density from /Python Code/Crtitical/creating_ice_equiv_ngripdensity.ipynb, calculated via the EGRIP methodology. https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.962754. Not perfect, but better than existing singular datasets.

acc rate, thinning function, LID from AICC2012

horizons/intervals will be from layer count, which was adjusted to ngrip 1 until age 730 then ngrip2 for rest from GICC21 (till 3244). Then, using GICC05 for rest.
