# GRIP 1991 shallow core densities
# Continuous density data on shallow core with diameter of 7.78 cm. Profile starts at 5.53m.
# Extracted from JPs data base Aug 1st, 2025
# Copenhagen depth convention: Depth, value is for the deep end of each interval. So 5.53-6.53 m has density 434.2 kg/m^3
# Units are not given in source but should be depth (m) and density in kg/m^3
